# Finding_Donors_For_CharityML

This is one of the projects completed and passed successfully with Udacity's 'Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch' Nanodegree.

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley 
that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. 

My goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm 
will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent to ask for donations.
